# warshall
floyd warshall is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights
A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
Although it does not return details of the paths themselves, 
it is possible to reconstruct the paths with simple modifications to the algorithm.
